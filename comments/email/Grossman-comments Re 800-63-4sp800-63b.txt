Sorry I meant 5.1.1.2.

Also https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#complexity doesn't seem to mention repeated 
characters which confuses things even more.

800-63-4/sp800-63b says in 5.1.1.1 "For example, the list MAY include, but is not limited to:... 
Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. ‘aaaaaa’, ‘1234abcd’)." but then a few lines later says " 
Verifiers SHALL NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., ...prohibiting consecutively repeated 
characters) for memorized secrets  "

To me this seems like contradictory advice.

Thanks,
