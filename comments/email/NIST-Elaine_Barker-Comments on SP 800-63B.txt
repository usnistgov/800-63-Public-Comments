substantive comments are provided below.

1.   Line 526: Why use "SHOULD NOT" rather than "SHALL NOT"?
2.    Lines 702-703: What is the point of even having a hint if the claimant is not yet authenticated and is 
disallowed from seeing it? Reword?
3.    Check with the CTG (Morrie?) that these are acceptable examples.
4.    Lines 760-761: SP 800-107 will be withdrawn. Refer to the SHA-2 functions in FIPS 180 (but not 
include SHA-1, which is in the process of being sunset). Also, consider whether SP 800-132 and SP 
800-108 would be appropriate.
5.    Line 775 and other references to SP 800-90A: The reference should be to the SP 800-90 series, 
which consists of SP 800-90A, SP 800-90B, and SP 800-90C.
6.    Lines 793-794: Throughout the document, there are discussions about random bit generators 
(RBGs), security strength, and entropy. The discussions that mention entropy are particularly 
troublesome. In most cases, it would be better to refer to the length of a value (the look-up secret in 
this case) and refer to a new section that explains what is required. In this case, the look-up secret 
needs to be a random value at least 20 bits (or 6 digits) long and include a reference to the new 
section. This section would say that to get n random bits, a validated RBG (as specified in the SP 800-
90 series and validated by the CMVP) that provides a security strength of at least X bits needs to be 
used to generate the n bits, where X is provided in SP 800-131A (112 at present). Some comments 
below explain how to use this new section.
7.    Lines 804-805: This might require a very large list. This type of authenticator might be unusable for 
some applications. This might be mentioned here.
8.    Lines 806-810: Why use two different ways?
9.    Line 813: Using a new section as described in comment 6 above, this could just say talk about the 
look-up secret as being less that 64 bits in length.
10.  Line 902: Does this mean that there would be no retries if incorrectly entered? Or do you mean only 
one secret is sent by the verifier during a 10-minute period; once the secret is returned correctly 
during that period, a replay of it cannot be accepted?
11.  Lines 903-904: The verifier csn check that the random authentication secret is at least 20 bits long. 
The verifier is probably not going to know how much entropy it has unless it has a way of knowing 
how it was generated. Likewise, in line 905, the verifier can check if the secret is less than 64 bits in 
length.
12.  Line 975: 6 decimal digits is 20 bits in LENGTH. 
13.  Line 1063: The verifier can only check the length of the secret (at least 64 bits long), not the amount 
of entropy.
14.  Line 1190: Be sure to define "direct connection" when first mentioned. I think there is an example 
later in the document.
15.  Line 1191: Make sure that an endpoint is defined in relation to an authenticator (perhaps provide a 
figure).
16.  Line 1529: The pairing code SHALL be at least 20 bits (6 digits) long and be randomly generated as 
specified the new section discussed in comment 6 above.
17.  Lines 1680-1681: Is the subscriber assumed to have two addresses?
18.  Line 1710-1711: The binding code SHALL be at least 40 bits long (or at least 112 bits long)and 
randomly generated (refer to the new section discussed in comment 6).
19.  Lines 1839-1840: Secrets are at least 64 bits long and randomly generated as specified in [insert the 
appropriate section number].
20.  Section 9.4: This section is really hard to read and understand by readers not familiar with the 
concepts, acronyms, laws and regulations (i.e., me). Is this understandable by the intended audience 
of this section? This is not in plain language! Spell out the acronyms, expand the explanation, or 
something.
21.  Section 10.1: Users should be able to choose based on the type of memorized secret they need to 
provide (e.g., it's hard to enter a password when having to switch between upper and lower cases, 
numbers and special characters on a cell phone or tablet).
22.  Line 2142: Most people don't know the difference between serif and non-serif. Provide a footnote?
